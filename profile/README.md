### About Nell

If you've read any of the Molly Sutton books, you have a pretty good idea about some things Nell is wild about: France, travel, croissants (who isn't?!), and the familiar relationships of small town life. At the moment she's living in Virginia. And always daydreaming about living in France again someday.

### Why I write these books

It's a tough world out there. And we can all use an escape sometimes, right?!
I want my escapes to be full of the things I love most about being alive on this earth: Coffee. Love. Almond croissants.
Justice being served. Friendship. More coffee, with plenty of cream.

The satisfaction of a puzzle solved.
France, in all its everyday details as well as its grandeur. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
And that's the Molly Sutton Mysteries, in a nutshell :)
